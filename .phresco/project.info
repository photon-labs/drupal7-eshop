Traditionally, Drupal has hard-coded most of this, particularly in how taxonomy and tracker lists are formatted.\n\nThis tool is essentially a smart query builder that, given enough information, can build the proper query, execute it, and display the results. It has four modes, plus a special mode, and provides an impressive amount of functionality from these modes.\n\nAmong other things, Views can be used to generate reports, create summaries, and display collections of images and other content.\nYou need Views if\n\nYou like the default front page view, but you find you want to sort it differently.\nYou like the default taxonomy/term view, but you find you want to sort it differently; for example, alphabetically.\nYou use /tracker, but you want to restrict it to posts of a certain type.\nYou like the idea of the \u0027article\u0027 module, but it doesn\u0027t display articles the way you like.\nYou want a way to display a block with the 5 most recent posts of some particular type.\nYou want to provide \u0027unread forum posts\u0027.\nYou want a monthly archive similar to the typical Movable Type/Wordpress archives that displays a link to the in the form of \"Month, YYYY (X)\" where X is the number of posts that month, and displays them in a block. The links lead to a simple list of posts for that month. \n\nViews can do a lot more than that, but those are some of the obvious uses of Views.\nDependencies\n\nThe Drupal 7 version of Views requires the Chaos Tool Suite also known as CTools.\nViews\u0027 bug squad\n\nThe Views\u0027 bug squad is a group of people who have dedicated a few hours a week to help provide support and fix bugs in the issue queue.

Additionally, it provides an entity CRUD controller, which helps simplifying the creation of new entity types.\n\nFeatures\n\nThis is an API module, so it doesn\u0027t provide any end-user features. However, users may enable the entity tokens module, which provides token replacements for all entity properties that have no tokens and are known to the entity API.\n\nOverview\n\nThe module provides API functions allowing modules to create, save, delete, view or to determine access for any entity, i.e. entity_create(), entity_save(), entity_delete(), entity_view() and entity_access().\n\nThe entity API introduces a unique place for metadata about entity relationships and entity properties: hook_entity_property_info(). This information about entity properties contains the data type and callbacks for how to get and set the data of a property. Modules may rely on this information in order to support any entity property, e.g. Rules and the Search API build upon that.\n\nFurthermore the module provides data wrappers that make use of the available information to provide a simple and unified access to entities and their properties. For usage examples have a look at the README or the provided tests.\n\nBeside that, the module helps you defining a new entity type. For that, it provides an entity controller, which implements full CRUD functionality for your entities. Optionally, entities may be created based on classes derived from the provided Entity class.\n\nThe entity API cares about creating fieldable entities as well as exportable entities, however it does not yet support revisions. Additionally it supports implementing bundle entities, i.e. bundle objects (like node types) for fieldable entities implemented as (exportable) entities, for which the appropriate field API callbacks get automatically invoked.\n\nFor entity types implemented based upon the provided CRUD API the API is providing additional module integration too, i.e. Rules events are provided for all CRUD-related hooks, some basic entity property information for hook_entity_property_info() is provided and exportable entities are automatically integrated with the Features module.\n\nThese module integrations are implemented in separate controller classes, which may be separately overridden or enabled/deactivated.\nOptionally, the entity API also helps providing an administrative interface for managing entities, e.g. the UI for managing profile types of Profile 2 is built with that.\n","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"documentsid":0,"version":"7.x-1.0-rc1","url":"/modules/tech-phpdru7/files/mod_entity_api_7.x-1.0-rc1/7.x-1.0-rc1/mod_entity_api_7.x-1.0-rc1-7.x-1.0-rc1.zip","modulesid":0}]}],"documentsid":0,"version":"7.x-3.0-rc2","url":"/modules/tech-phpdru7/files/mod_ubercart_7.x-3.0-rc2/7.x-3.0-rc2/mod_ubercart_7.x-3.0-rc2-7.x-3.0-rc2.tar.gz","modulesid":0}]}],"documentsid":0,"version":"7.0","url":"/modules/tech-phpdru7/files/mod_shopmenu_7.0/7.0/mod_shopmenu_7.0-7.0.zip","modulesid":0}]}],"servers":[{"id":5,"name":"Apache","versions":["2.3"],"description":"Apache"}],"databases":[{"id":1,"name":"MySQL","versions":["5.5.1"],"description":"My SQL DB"}],"emailSupported":false,"versions":["7.8"]},"application":"apptype-webapp","pilotProjectName":"EShop","projectCode":"DrupalEshop"}
